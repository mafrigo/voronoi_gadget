# voronoi_gadget
## Description
Creates mock integral field unit (IFU) galaxy images from galaxy simulations. 
The code uses pygad (https://bitbucket.org/broett/pygad) to open simulation snapshots, 
meaning it supports natively Gadget and Arepo simulations, but it can also be used on 
other formats with some tweaking.

## Usage example:
see example_script.py.

## Output example:
See figures 4,5,6,10,11 in Frigo et al. 2019 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.11059.pdf).
